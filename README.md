# Research Programming in the Life Sciences

* Lab1: Intro to Python
  * **countAT**: calculate A-T percentage in DNA seq
  * **countNucleotide**: calculate number of nucleotides in DNA seq

* Lab2: Manipulating Data Types 
  * **seqCleaner**: collapse substring of ambiguous nucleotides in a sequence

  of three-element isomers
  
* Lab3: Flow Control
  * **proteinParams**: calculate physical-chemical protein properties 
  including pL, mass & molar extinction, molecular weight, and amino
  acid composition.

* Lab4: Files and Modules
  * **sequenceAnalysis**: store an RNA/DNA protein sequence and provide its length, translation, 
  amino acid composition, and relative codon bias.
   * **compareGenomes**: compare GC content, amino acid composition, and relative codon bias
   of two genomes
